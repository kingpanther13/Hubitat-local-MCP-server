    "releaseNotes": "v0.1.15 - Fix required fields validation error on rule creation:\n- Added clearAllSubPageSettings() to clear orphaned trigger/condition/action settings\n- Prevents 'please fill out all required fields' error when sub-page forms were partially filled\n- mainPage now clears all sub-page settings on entry to ensure clean validation state\n\nv0.1.14 - Fix child app label not updating in Hubitat Apps list:\n- Rules created via UI now properly show their name in the Apps list\n- Added app.updateLabel() calls to installed(), updated(), and updateRuleFromParent()\n- Previously UI-created rules showed as 'MCP Rule' instead of the actual rule name\n\nv0.1.13 - Fix Hubitat sandbox compatibility:\n- Removed private/static modifiers not allowed in Hubitat Groovy sandbox\n- Fixed HPM update errors\n\nv0.1.12 - Performance improvements and documentation:\n- Added performance warnings to resource-intensive tools (list_devices, get_device_events, list_rules)\n- Duration triggers now support minutes/hours units with 2-hour max limit\n- Captured states limit now user-configurable (default 20, range 1-100) with automatic cleanup and warnings\n- Added new tools: list_captured_states, delete_captured_state, clear_captured_states\n- Fixed duration timer state accumulation\n- Added Performance Considerations section to README (C7/C8/C8 Pro guidance)\n\nv0.1.11 - Added verification reminders to tool descriptions:\n- All state-changing tools now remind AI to verify changes took effect\n- list_devices reminds AI to verify device names, not guess\n\nv0.1.10 - Fixed device label returning null:\n- send_command and get_attribute now properly return device label in response\n- Captures label before operations to avoid Groovy serialization issues\n\nv0.1.9 - Fixed missing condition type validations:\n- Added validation for: presence, lock, thermostat_mode, thermostat_state, illuminance, power\n- These condition types were documented but validation was missing\n\nv0.1.8 - Fixed duration triggers firing repeatedly:\n- After firing, trigger won't fire again until condition goes FALSE first\n- Prevents repeated triggering while condition stays true\n\nv0.1.7 - Fixed duration-based triggers:\n- device_event triggers with duration now properly wait for condition to stay true\n- Uses runIn() timer that cancels if condition becomes false\n- No longer triggers on every event when duration is specified\n\nv0.1.6 - Fixed repeat action:\n- Now accepts both 'times' and 'count' parameters\n\nv0.1.5 - Fixed capture_state/restore_state:\n- States now stored in parent app so any rule can restore states captured by any other rule\n\nv0.1.4 - Added remaining documented actions:\n- set_color: Set color (hue, saturation, level) on RGB devices\n- set_color_temperature: Set color temperature on CT bulbs\n- lock/unlock: Lock or unlock lock devices\n- capture_state/restore_state: Save and restore device states\n- send_notification: Send push notifications to notification devices\n- repeat: Repeat actions N times\n\nv0.1.3 - Major rule engine fixes:\n- Fixed delay action: now uses runIn() for proper async delays\n- Added variable condition: check local and global variables\n- Added device_was condition: check if device has been in state for X seconds\n- Added presence, lock, thermostat_mode, thermostat_state, illuminance, power conditions\n- Fixed localVariables: now properly passed to rules on create/update\n- Added getVariableValue helper for child apps\n\nv0.1.2 - Fixed missing action types in rule engine:\n- if_then_else: Conditional branching now works\n- cancel_delayed: Cancel pending delayed actions\n- set_local_variable: Set rule-scoped variables\n- activate_scene: Activate scene devices\n\nv0.1.1 - Pagination for list_devices:\n- Added offset/limit parameters to list_devices tool\n- Fixes 'detailed=true' failing over Hubitat Cloud (128KB limit)\n- Use limit=20-30 with detailed=true for cloud access\n- Response now includes total, hasMore, nextOffset for pagination\n\nv0.1.0 - Parent/Child Architecture:\n- Rules are now child apps with isolated settings\n- Fixed settings cross-contamination between rules\n\nv0.0.6 - Fixed trigger/condition/action save flow.\nv0.0.5 - Bug fixes and UI improvements.\nv0.0.4 - Added full Rule Engine UI.\nv0.0.3 - Initial release.",
