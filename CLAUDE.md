## Code style

**Hubitat Groovy sandbox** (`hubitat-mcp-server.groovy`, `hubitat-mcp-rule.groovy`) blocks several JVM features the runtime would otherwise expose. Highlights — see `tests/sandbox_lint.py` for the full set:

- `Eval.*`, `GroovyShell`, `Class.forName`, `Runtime.exec`, `new Thread`, `new File` / `java.io.File` — not allowed
- `getClass()` — reflection blocked
- `log.isDebugEnabled()` — not exposed
- `Date.format(String, Locale)` — only the no-Locale overload works
- Filesystem only via the hub File Manager API (`/hub/fileManager`); MCP-tool surface is `list_files` / `read_file` / `write_file` / `delete_file`

Use `atomicState` for thread-safe persistence, `state` for UI/counters. Compare device IDs as strings (`.toString()`).

## Tool design rules

These rules apply to every MCP tool added or renamed. Cached MCP clients refresh their tool list on update — no deprecation aliases are shipped.

### Tool naming

- **Universal service prefix.** Every MCP tool name begins with `hub_`. Anthropic's verified guidance: prefix-namespacing tools by service has "non-trivial effects on our tool-use evaluations" — *writing-tools-for-agents* (2025-09-11). Example: `hub_list_devices`, `hub_create_room`, `hub_call_device_command`.
- **Verb-noun order.** After the `hub_` prefix, the name reads verb-noun. Verbs are drawn from the strict vocabulary table below. Nouns are the most natural English for the entity in context (drop redundant qualifiers — e.g., `rule` is preferred over `rm_rule` where context disambiguates).
- **Gateway verbs — `manage_` (write-bearing) and `read_` (pure-read).** A gateway's verb encodes whether it can mutate. **`manage_`** names any gateway that contains at least one write tool, whether mixed read+write or write-only (e.g., `hub_manage_rooms`, `hub_manage_code`, `hub_manage_destructive_ops`). **`read_`** names a gateway whose every sub-tool is read-only (e.g., `hub_read_apps_code`, `hub_read_diagnostics`). This lets an AI consumer enable the `hub_read_*` gateways for safe read-only access while gating every write-bearing `hub_manage_*` gateway behind a write permission. `manage_` MAY also be used by a **flat-only tool** — one that never sits behind any gateway and is always kept top-level on `tools/list` — even though it is not itself a gateway. The canonical case is a flat tool that action-dispatches a small set (≤4) of verbs on a single noun (current example: `hub_manage_virtual_device` with `action: "create"/"delete"`). Don't introduce more flat `manage_` tools without explicit maintainer sign-off. A gateway `read_` prefix is distinct from the file-manager **leaf** tools `hub_read_file`/`hub_write_file` (see the verb table) — those keep their own `read`/`write` verbs; the noun (`file` vs a gateway domain) disambiguates.
- **Multi-gateway membership.** A tool MAY appear under more than one gateway when both gateway domains apply.
- **Gateway read/write split.** A read-only tool MUST be reachable from a `hub_read_*` gateway (or be a flat top-level tool) — it may never be unique to a `hub_manage_*` gateway. A `hub_manage_*` gateway MAY be mixed (carry its read tools too, for workflow cohesion) as long as those reads are *also* surfaced in a `hub_read_*` gateway via multi-gateway membership (same tool listed in both; no code duplication). This guarantees an AI consumer can reach every read through a pure-read surface while disabling every write-bearing `manage_` gateway. Pure-read gateways enable cleaner per-gateway disable in LLM client settings and clearer mental models for AI consumers.
- **Hard rename, no aliases.** Non-conforming tools are renamed in lockstep when the convention requires it. The expectation: MCP clients refresh their cached tool list on server update. No deprecation aliases are shipped.

### Verb vocabulary

Tools use exactly one verb from the table below. The table is the canonical list — `write` (file-manager leaf tools), `report` (locked to one tool), and `reboot`/`shutdown` (destructive-ops domain) are narrow exceptions to the otherwise-general verb vocabulary. `read` is dual-purpose: the file-manager leaf verb (`hub_read_file`) AND the verb for pure-read **gateways** (`hub_read_*`). `manage` is the verb for write-bearing gateways (see Tool naming).

| Verb | Semantic | Folds in |
|---|---|---|
| `list` | Plural read, returns array of summaries | — |
| `get` | Singular read OR diagnostic verdict | `find`, `check`, `validate` |
| `search` | Read with query, returns ranked array | — |
| `test` | Dry-run with no side effects | — |
| `create` | Write that produces a new entity | `install` |
| `update` | Write that mutates one or more existing fields in place (PATCH-like) | `rename` |
| `delete` | Write that destroys an entity (no ID = delete all) | `clear`, `remove` |
| `set` | Write that assigns a value/state (`set_X_<attr>`) or replaces an entity wholesale (`set_X`, PUT-like) | `pause`, `resume`, `enable`, `disable`, `lock`, `unlock`, `mute`, `unmute`, `start`, `stop`, `open`, `close`, `assign`, `unassign` |
| `call` | Invoke a method / service / dispatch / device command | `send`, `dispatch`, `invoke`, `request`, `evaluate`, `run`, `force` |
| `manage` | Action-dispatch gateway that contains writes (mixed read+write or write-only), plus flat-only top-level tools (see Tool naming) | — |
| `restore` | Re-apply a prior backup | — |
| `import` / `export` | Round-trip serialization counterpart | — |
| `clone` | Duplicate an existing entity | — |
| `read` / `write` | File-manager **leaf** tools (`hub_read_file`, `hub_write_file`) — narrow exception. `read` is ALSO the verb for pure-read **gateways** (`hub_read_*`, every sub-tool read-only); the noun disambiguates a gateway domain from the `file` leaf | — |
| `report` | LOCKED to `hub_report_issue` only | — |
| `reboot` / `shutdown` | EXCEPTIONS — destructive-ops gateway only | — |

**Don't introduce new verbs without a justification stronger than "I felt like it."** If an existing verb fits, use it. The `set` vs `update` distinction is intentional: `set_X_<attr>` assigns one specific value or state; `set_X` replaces wholesale; `update_X` mutates a subset of fields in place. Author judgement applies per-tool.

Rule-engine action subtypes (`cancelTimers`, `cancelDelay`, etc. inside `custom_*` and `hub_set_rule` arguments) are separate from MCP tool names and not constrained by this vocabulary.

### Parameter naming

Name parameters unambiguously. `device_id`, not `id`. `user_id`, not `user`. Where the parameter takes a complex value, name the parameter after what it semantically IS, not how it's wired. Anthropic's verified guidance: *"instead of a parameter named user, try a parameter named user_id"* — *writing-tools-for-agents*.

### Tool consolidation guidelines

1. **Verb-pair tools.** Two tools doing opposite state mutations on the same noun (enable/disable, pause/resume, lock/unlock, mute/unmute, start/stop, open/close) → merge into a single `set_<noun>_<attribute>` tool. Name the merged tool after the boolean/enum attribute being toggled, NOT after one of the two verbs (so `hub_set_rule_paused`, not `hub_set_rule_state` — the latter reads as a generic edit). Use boolean when binary; enum only when 3+ states or values aren't naturally true/false. Concrete: `pause_rm_rule` + `resume_rm_rule` → `hub_set_rule_paused`.
2. **Flat multi-action tools.** A flat tool with an action enum is allowed ONLY when (a) actions share a noun, (b) action set is ≤4 verbs, and (c) a full `manage_` gateway would be overkill. Outside that, prefer separate tools or a real gateway. Concrete: `hub_manage_virtual_device` with `action: "create"/"delete"` fits.
3. **Tools always called in sequence.** If callers always invoke A then B with no useful intermediate point, merge them. Anthropic's verified guidance: `get_customer_context` over three separate lookups; `schedule_event` over `list_users` + `list_events` + `create_event` — *writing-tools-for-agents*.
4. **Overlapping noun + return shape.** Tools that only differ in a filter or projection should merge with an optional parameter. Recent example: PR #208 proposes a 103→95 tool reduction along these lines.
5. **Single-action edge verbs.** Don't add a new verb for a single-action tool when an existing verb fits. `clear`/`remove` fold into `delete`; `rename` into `update`; `run`/`force` into `call`; `install` into `create`.
6. **Anti-consolidation guardrails.** Don't merge tools whose error modes, safety gates, or payload shapes are fundamentally different (a write tool that demands `confirm`+backup with a no-confirm read tool). Don't merge a time-critical tool with one whose schema would inflate context on every call. When in doubt, leave them separate.

### Annotations — all four hints, every new tool

Every new MCP tool MUST set all four annotation hints explicitly:

- `readOnlyHint` — true if no environment modification.
- `destructiveHint` — true if the change is destructive / irreversible.
- `idempotentHint` — true if safe to retry with identical args.
- `openWorldHint` — true if the tool reaches beyond the hub to the open internet (GitHub fetches, bundle-URL downloads, importUrl source modes). The hub, its devices, and its radios are the closed-world system.

Emission policy: `readOnlyHint`, `idempotentHint`, and `openWorldHint` are ALWAYS emitted; `destructiveHint` is emitted on every write and deliberately omitted on reads (per the MCP spec it is only meaningful when `readOnlyHint=false` — the omission is spec-pinned by `McpToolAnnotationsSpec`). All derive centrally in `annotationsForLeaf`/`annotationsForGateway` from `getReadOnlyToolNames()` plus `getIdempotentToolNames()` (every read plus the retry-safe writes in `getIdempotentWriteToolNames()`; optional telemetry side effects of reads are by maintainer decision not writes) and `getOpenWorldToolNames()` — those getters are AGGREGATORS: a tool's membership is declared in its domain library's `_readOnlyToolNames_part<Name>` / `_idempotentWriteToolNames_part<Name>` / `_openWorldToolNames_part<Name>` chunk (see "Library modules"), so classifying a new tool means editing its library file, not the main file. An unlisted tool falls to write+destructive and non-idempotent (the cautious side); for `openWorldHint` the unlisted default is closed-world — an accuracy statement (the hub and its devices ARE the system), not caution, and since the MCP default for an *omitted* `openWorldHint` is true the key is always emitted explicitly. The symmetric idempotency snapshot and the open-world exact-set test in `McpToolAnnotationsSpec` force every classification through code review. Source: MCP blog *Tool Annotations as Risk Vocabulary* (2026-03-16). PR #202 (merged 2026-05-19) shipped the readOnlyHint/destructiveHint pair; idempotentHint + openWorldHint completed the surface via issue #238.

**Annotations are UX/risk hints, NOT a security boundary.** The MCP blog is explicit: *"They don't make the model resist prompt injection… annotations alone are not a control."* Safety in this project still requires the universal Read / Write master gates and `confirm` parameter checks. Annotations are advisory metadata to the client, nothing more. The annotation is the *declaration* of a tool's read/write nature; the masters are the *enforcement* of it (see Permission model below).

### Display metadata — friendly title + menu summary, every new tool MUST add one

Every leaf tool AND every gateway MUST have a display-meta entry — for a leaf tool it lives in its domain library's `_toolDisplayMeta_part<Name>()` chunk; gateway entries (and the main-resident native-RM tools) live in the `getToolDisplayMeta()` aggregator remainder in the main file. Each entry: a Title-Case `title` (emitted on the wire as MCP `annotations.title` — the friendly name that clients honoring the field, claude.ai among them, render instead of the bare name; also fed into the BM25 search corpus) and a one-sentence `summary` (≤140 chars, single line, ends with a period — rendered only in the Advanced per-tool overrides menu, never sent to the LLM). A PR that adds, renames, or removes a tool or gateway MUST update the map in the same PR — this is as mandatory as the annotation hints above, and `ToolDisplayMetaSpec`'s completeness, title-uniqueness, and shape guards fail the build if it is skipped.

### Permission model

Every MCP tool is gated. The layers, from broadest to narrowest:

- **Two universal masters — Read and Write (both default ON).** `enableRead` exposes every read-only / non-destructive tool (those in `getReadOnlyToolNames()`); `enableWrite` exposes every other (state-changing) tool. Only an explicit `== false` hides/blocks a class — null/unset means ON. Enforcement is **central**: a single classification-driven gate at the top of `executeTool()` (the dispatch chokepoint) rejects a blocked call ("Read tools are disabled…" / "Write tools are disabled…"). Gateway *names* are not classified here — they re-enter `executeTool()` per sub-tool, so each sub-tool is gated on re-entry. `getReadOnlyToolNames()` is the read/write partition; every leaf tool falls under exactly one master (guarded by a completeness spec). The annotation `readOnlyHint` is the per-tool *declaration*; the masters are the *enforcement*.
- **Destructive confirmation (orthogonal to the masters).** The destructive/sensitive write tools additionally call `requireDestructiveConfirm(confirm)` — `confirm=true` plus a hub backup within 24h. This is the same set that required it before, now independent of any toggle (the Write master gates them centrally first).
- **Developer Mode + Custom Rule Engine — additional layered gates.** `enableDeveloperMode` gates self-admin (`hub_update_mcp_settings`) and is deliberately UI-only to disable (lockout protection). The legacy Custom Rule Engine toggle drives `getCustomEngineMode()`: `full` (engine ON, all `custom_*` shown) / `readonly` (engine OFF + Read master ON: read `custom_*` shown, write `custom_*` hidden) / `off` (engine OFF + Read master OFF: all `custom_*` hidden).
- **Gateway mode — catalog *shape*, not a permission.** `useGateways` folds leaf tools under `hub_read_*` / `hub_manage_*` gateways vs. a flat `tools/list`; it changes how tools are surfaced, not whether they're allowed. The `hub_read_*` (pure-read) / `hub_manage_*` (write-bearing) split (see Tool naming) still holds — it lets a client enable read gateways while disabling write ones, complementing the Read/Write masters.
- **#114 advanced per-tool / per-gateway overrides (deny-only).** `disabled_tools` / `disabled_gateways` (set under *Advanced: Per-tool Overrides*) feed `getEffectiveDisabledTools()` → `getHiddenToolNames()`. They apply *below* the masters — they can only turn things OFF, never re-enable. A disabled tool disappears from `tools/list` and `hub_search_tools` everywhere it appears (including a tool shared across gateways, and tools inside a disabled gateway), and a cached call returns a **distinct** error: "…is disabled in Advanced settings (Per-tool Overrides)…". It stays documented in `hub_get_tool_guide`.

`getHiddenToolNames()` is the single source of truth consumed by both `getToolDefinitions()` (catalog) and `toolSearchTools()` (search corpus), so the two surfaces cannot drift.

### Tool descriptions

- **First line:** concise summary of what the tool does. Tool descriptions are what the LLM reads when deciding whether to call this tool; the first line is what gets noticed.
- **Body:** usage guidance — when/how to use the tool, performance notes, pagination guidance, behavioural expectations.
- **Write tools:** safety warning + mandatory pre-flight checklist directly in the description (already required; reaffirmed).
- **Make implicit context explicit.** Terminology quirks, query-language constraints, resource relationships — write them in. Anthropic: *"Even small refinements to tool descriptions can yield dramatic improvements."*
- **Semantic names beat opaque UUIDs.** Where a tool returns an identifier, prefer human-meaningful names over raw UUIDs; if a technical ID is needed for chaining, expose both name AND id. Anthropic: *"resolving arbitrary alphanumeric UUIDs to more semantically meaningful and interpretable language… significantly improves Claude's precision in retrieval tasks by reducing hallucinations."*
- **Length: match it to complexity; cut fluff, not substance.** ~3-4 sentences for a complex tool (Anthropic floor), 1-2 for a simple one (OpenAI). Tool defs are re-sent to the model every turn, so trim redundancy and padding — but NEVER drop load-bearing content (purpose, scope, critical parameter formats, safety, behavioural quirks) to save bytes. Sources: Anthropic *define-tools* (*"at least 3-4 sentences… more if complex"*); OpenAI *GPT-5.2 guide* (*"1-2 sentences for what they do and when to use them"*, 2025-12-11).
- **`get_tool_guide` is a supplement, not an offload target.** Many agents won't call it even when told to, so anything an agent NEEDS to use the tool correctly stays in the description / parameter descriptions. Route only DEEP reference (exhaustive capability tables, long worked examples) into `get_tool_guide` / `[[FLAT_TRIM]]`.
- **Examples: not stuffed in the description body.** Put a concrete format example in the relevant *parameter's* description (e.g. `"…e.g. 2026-02-04T14:00"`); route full worked examples to `get_tool_guide`. (`input_examples` is the spec-native home but is incompatible with the Tool Search Tool, so gateway/deferred tools keep example content in description/param text.) Sources: Anthropic *advanced-tool-use* (2025-11-24); OpenAI *GPT-4.1 / GPT-5.2 guides*.
- **Deferred/gateway tools are also a retrieval surface.** The `tools/list` name + description + parameter descriptions feed the BM25 tool-search index, so include semantic keywords matching how users phrase the task — not just mechanics. Source: Anthropic *tool-search-tool* (matches this repo's gateway / `hub_search_tools` retrieval model).

### Schema design

- `inputSchema` root is `type: "object"` with `properties` (existing rule; reaffirmed).
- Use `enum` to constrain allowed values where there is a fixed set. Reduces invalid-arg errors and gives the LLM a usable hint.
- The `required` array is present only when there ARE required parameters; absent for fully-optional tools (existing rule; reaffirmed).
- **`outputSchema` — add one to every new tool, for consistency (a project convention, NOT a spec requirement).** The MCP spec marks `outputSchema` **optional**; its only normative `MUST` is conditional — *if* a server publishes one, its structured results must conform (clients SHOULD validate). We add one everywhere anyway so the tool surface is uniform and LLM clients can see each tool's return shape up front — genuinely useful for the many tools whose output varies by mode/condition, marginal for fixed-shape ones. **Do NOT add `structuredContent`:** this server returns tool results as a text block only, so `outputSchema` here is a discovery/documentation aid, not a wire-format contract to fulfill. Model the *success* shape; for multi-mode tools use a superset object (union of possible keys, none `required`). Strip it in the size-constrained flat `tools/list` (it is published in gateway mode + the gateway catalog). Source: MCP spec — `/server/tools` (`outputSchema` is Optional).
- **Forward-looking.** The MCP specification next-revision Release Candidate (RC locked 2026-05-21, targets 2026-07-28 publication) adds `_meta` on every request and `ttlMs`/`cacheScope` cache hints on list responses. Not required today; flagged here so future tool work doesn't re-discover it.

### Error contracts

- **Validation errors** (caller-recoverable, bad args): throw `IllegalArgumentException`. Caught by `handleToolsCall` and mapped to JSON-RPC `-32602`. Existing pattern; reaffirmed.
- **Runtime errors** (operation tried and failed for non-arg reasons): return `[success: false, error: <human-readable>, note: <actionable guidance>]`. Don't throw — the AI needs a structured error.
- **`isError: true` envelope** for tool-execution errors per MCP spec 2025-06-18. Already adopted in v0.7.7+ (see SKILL.md § Version Management for the adoption note).
- **Specific, actionable, recovery-oriented error text.** Tell the model how to recover. Anthropic recommends steering truncation errors toward recovery strategies like *"many small and targeted searches instead of a single, broad search."*
- **Point error/recovery text at `get_tool_guide`.** When a tool has a `get_tool_guide` section, its `note` / error text SHOULD reference it (e.g. *"…see `hub_get_tool_guide(section='X')` for the full reference"*). Many agents skip the guide otherwise — an in-context error pointer is an extra nudge to actually consult it, and it lets the live description stay lean without losing the deep reference.

### Pagination & response-size discipline

- Tools that can return long lists MUST support the project's universal cursor convention (`cursor` / `nextCursor`), unless the response naturally fits within the 120KB `tools/call` cap. Current cursor-paginated tools are listed in `TOOL_GUIDE.md`.
- For tools where a "concise" vs "detailed" payload distinction is useful, support a `response_format` enum or equivalent. Anthropic's worked example reduced a response from 206 tokens to 72 just by adding the enum.
- The universal 120KB response-size guard at `handleMcpRequest` remains the backstop — it is NOT a substitute for in-tool filtering, pagination, or projection.

### Testing & eval

- Every new MCP tool ships with BOTH a direct-call (unit) test AND a dispatch-envelope (integration) test under `src/test/groovy/` (existing CONTRIBUTING.md rule; reaffirmed).
- **e2e coverage is mandatory for changes and bug fixes, not just new tools.** Any change to tool behaviour, dispatch/gateway routing, the transport/protocol layer, or any bug fix that a live-hub MCP client could observe MUST add or update a `tests/e2e_test.py` scenario in the same PR, alongside the Spock unit/integration tests. The Spock suite proves the logic in isolation against the `hubitat_ci` harness; the `e2e` job proves it against a real hub through the cloud MCP endpoint. A green Spock matrix is necessary but not sufficient — if a client could see the difference, e2e must cover it. When adding or renaming a tool, keep `tests/e2e_test.py` and the e2e deploy scripts under `.github/scripts/` in lockstep with the tool surface — stale tool names there are a silent e2e-only break.
- If the tool's behaviour affects live-hub flows, add a `tests/BAT-v2.md` scenario in the same PR.
- **New RM e2e scenarios extend the existing per-concern rule tests; keep every rule SMALL.** The classic wizard re-sends the full rule page on every `submitOnChange` POST, so per-edit cost grows with rule size — one rule accumulating many actions/triggers is exactly the load curve that trips the hub's per-app load limiter (the old 14-substep mega-test did; it is now split into small per-concern tests in `tests/e2e_test.py`, each owning a pristine `BAT_E2E_*` rule created and deleted in the test). Add new RM coverage to the matching existing per-concern test; start another small rule test only when the scenario conflicts with an existing rule's state (e.g. a second Required Expression) or its subject IS rule creation/deletion. That family runs STRICT on relay 504s (a dropped response raises and the runner re-runs the small test once on a fresh rule) — never soft-skip a wire-format assertion there.
- Track tool errors during eval. High invalid-parameter rates usually indicate the description or examples are the bug, not the model. Anthropic's example: Claude was appending `2025` to web-search queries until the description was fixed.

### e2e architecture: the standalone dead-man watchdog (test-hub only)

The `e2e` job (`hub-e2e.yml`) proves a PR against a live Hubitat test hub: deploy the PR's code, run `tests/e2e_test.py` against it, then restore main. The MCP server cannot reliably update its OWN app class (the recompile kills the in-flight request → the issue #237 self-update 504), so the install + restore are driven through a **separate** app: the **E2E Dead-Man Watchdog v2** (`e2e-deadman-watchdog-v2.groovy`) — a second, smaller MCP server installed once on the test hub with its own OAuth `/mcp` endpoint (the `WATCHDOG_MCP_URL` secret). It is **test-hub tooling ONLY**: never in the HPM manifest (`packageManifest.json`), never on a user hub. Two endpoints are in play — `MCP_URL` = the main server under test (the tests + all normal hub calls go here); `WATCHDOG_URL` = the watchdog (all backup/install/restore plumbing goes here, so the app being recompiled is never the one answering the request).

Per-run flow (all over `WATCHDOG_URL` unless noted), driven by `.github/scripts/mcp_watchdog_*.sh` (shared helpers in `mcp_watchdog_lib.sh`):
1. **Health check** — the watchdog answers `tools/list` + `hub_get_info`, else HALT before any mutation.
2. **Lease** — serialize runs on the single shared hub (a hub variable with a TTL).
3. **Arm** (`mcp_arm_watchdog.sh`) — record canonical `main`'s install URLs (the bundle's `bundle-artifacts` `shas/<MAIN_SHA>/` zip + parent + child raw https URLs at `MAIN_SHA`) plus expected char counts into the flag manifest, and write an armed flag with a ~35-min deadline. Nothing is installed or cached on the hub; the restore installs straight from those URLs.
4. **Install PR** (`mcp_watchdog_deploy.sh`) — bundle → every manifest app (full HPM repair: it deploys the parent AND child apps, overriding whatever is installed; the bundle delivers every `#include`d library, so there is no separate per-library install step — installing a library individually AND via the bundle was redundant and forced an extra recompile). Each app deploy is confirmed via a FRESH `lastSelfDeploy` success (survives the relay-dropped ~1.6 MB response AND a same-length change, so a stale source can't false-green).
5. **Tests** — `tests/e2e_test.py` against `MCP_URL`.
6. **Disarm / restore** (`mcp_disarm_watchdog.sh`) — the watchdog's on-hub `checkDeadman` timer restores main by installing the bundle + every app from the canonical https URLs in the flag manifest (the HPM-repair path). CI fires an early disarm on a clean finish; if CI can't (the run crashed), the watchdog auto-restores at the deadline — the dead-man.

The watchdog itself is **not** deployed by e2e. **e2e never writes to the watchdog app** — it only drives the standing watchdog's endpoint (arm / install PR / restore). The maintainer updates the watchdog app on the test hub out-of-band, via a DIRECT connection to the e2e hub, through either of two paths: (1) the watchdog **self-updates** over its own `/mcp` endpoint (`hub_update_app` with `selfUpdate`/`selfClassId` — the issue-#237-safe self-reload path), or (2) the **main MCP server** app on the e2e hub updates the watchdog's Apps Code class (`hub_manage_code` → `hub_update_app` with `importUrl`). A PR that changes `e2e-deadman-watchdog-v2.groovy` is validated by the Spock suite (`WatchdogV2Spec`) plus that out-of-band deploy, not by an in-run self-update.

**The watchdog's admin tools are COPIES of the server's code-install tools** (`hub_update_app` with the #237 verbatim-error capture, `hub_get_source`, library/bundle install, file manager, `hub_get_info`, etc.), kept in lockstep so the watchdog can install whatever a PR ships. **Any tool that participates in installing a PR MUST be mirrored into `e2e-deadman-watchdog-v2.groovy`, not just added to the server** — otherwise the e2e install can't use it. Concretely: PR #247's **bundle tools** belong in the watchdog as well as the server, since bundles are part of how a PR is installed. (When you mirror a tool, copy its behaviour faithfully and re-run sandbox lint on the watchdog; the watchdog has its own `WatchdogV2Spec`.)

### e2e CI: `pull_request_target` trigger + how to validate workflow changes

`hub-e2e.yml` runs on **`pull_request_target`** (NOT `pull_request`) on purpose: a FORK contributor's PR (e.g. @level99's) can then run e2e against the shared test hub with the `WATCHDOG_MCP_URL` / `MCP_URL` secrets, gated behind the `approve` environment for non-trusted authors. **Do NOT "fix" a red `e2e` badge by gating the trigger to same-repo branches** — that is the old behaviour and it re-excludes fork contributors, the exact problem this setup solves. The trade-off is how `pull_request_target` resolves files: the **workflow file itself** (`hub-e2e.yml`'s step structure) always comes from **main**, while the job **checks out the PR head's code**, so `.github/scripts/*`, `tests/e2e_test.py`, the watchdog groovy, and `hubitat-mcp-server.groovy` are the PR's. So:

- **Changing the CONTENT of an existing script / test / groovy file** (logic inside the e2e `.sh` scripts, `tests/e2e_test.py`, or the server/rule/watchdog source) → the auto `e2e` check exercises the PR's code in-PR. **Iterate normally** — this works for fork PRs too, which is the whole point. New MCP tools (incl. e.g. PR #247's bundle tools) and their `tests/e2e_test.py` scenarios fall here: no special handling.
- **Restructuring the workflow FILE** — adding/removing/renaming a *step*, or deleting/renaming a script the base workflow *calls* — is NOT exercised by the auto check (it runs main's old structure, usually RED against the PR's deleted/renamed files). Validate such a PR with **`gh workflow run hub-e2e.yml --ref <branch>`** (`workflow_dispatch` runs the PR branch's OWN workflow file) and watch that run; the PR's `e2e` badge stays red until merge, and the dispatch run is the merge-readiness proof. This is the ONLY case that needs the dispatch dance (e.g. PR #248 restructured the steps and deleted the old deploy scripts).

## The custom MCP rule engine is legacy

`hubitat-mcp-rule.groovy` (the MCP child app, surfaced through the `custom_*` tools) is **legacy**. It still ships and still gets bug fixes, but it is **closed to new feature work** — Hubitat's native Rule Machine is the supported path now and exposes equivalent functionality through `hub_set_rule` (in the `hub_manage_rule_machine` gateway) plus `hub_set_native_app` / `hub_delete_native_app` and the rest of the `hub_manage_native_rules_and_apps` group. New rule-related capabilities should land on the parent app's native-RM tools, not on the child app. If a feature request lands on the child app, propose it for the native side instead.

## Vendored hub admin-UI source (`resources/hub2-source/`) — READ THIS FOLDER

`resources/hub2-source/` holds a large body of **reverse-engineered reference material** about Hubitat's HTTP / admin-UI surface that exists **nowhere else** — not in this server's code, not in Hubitat's published docs, not searchable from the outside. It was obtained by vendoring the hub's own browser bundles and probing a live hub, and it is catalogued in the folder's `README.md`: an **endpoint inventory**, JSON payload / data shapes, the classic-app wire format, the modern Vue data contracts, and the full UI component map. **A lot of what's in there can only be found by opening that folder and reading it** — so make a habit of checking it.

**Before reverse-engineering ANY hub behaviour** — a new or undocumented endpoint, a payload/response shape, an app's data model, a native / RM wire format, how some UI feature talks to the server, what JSON a Vue page POSTs — **go read `resources/hub2-source/` (its `README.md` first) before deriving anything by hand from the live UI.** String literals survive minification, so `grep` against the bundles finds endpoint paths, field keys, and capability names directly.

What's catalogued there:

- **`vue-hub2.min.js`** — the modern Vue 3 SPA (~548 components). The contract for the Vue-rewritten apps (Basic Rules, Visual Rules Builder / `VisualRuleBuilder20`, hub variables, device swap, dashboards, Z-Wave/Zigbee admin, backups, …) is the JSON those components POST.
- **`appUI.js` + `main.js`** — the classic `dynamicPage` / `submitOnChange` engine that drives Rule Machine and every other classic app. The genuine wire-format reference for the native-RM tools (`submitOnChange` re-POST, `stateAttribute` buttons, page transitions, `/installedapp/update/json`, `/installedapp/btn`, `/installedapp/ssr`). The Vue bundle black-boxes RM; this is where RM's protocol actually lives.
- supporting bundles plus the README's growing **endpoint inventory** (e.g. `/app/ruleBuilderJson` — classic RM compiled rule state as JSON).

When you discover a new endpoint, shape, or data model from these bundles, **add it to the folder's `README.md`** so the next person finds it there. Re-capture the bundles and refresh the inventory when new firmware changes the UI.

## Library modules (`#include`) — the modularization path (issue #209)

The server is being split out of the single `hubitat-mcp-server.groovy` monolith into Groovy `#include` libraries under `libraries/`. `#include` is a **textual paste**: the library body is inlined into the app's compiled class at parse time (no method boundary, no separate runtime), so library methods, `state`/`atomicState`, and string-literal `subscribe`/`schedule` handlers all resolve as if written in the app. Read this before adding or moving code into a library.

### What moves to the library vs stays in the app

**EVERYTHING per-tool lives in the tool's domain library — one file per tool edit.** When you extract a tool group (or author a new tool), the library carries:

- the tool **definitions**, in a `_getAllToolDefinitions_part<Name>()` chunk method that `getAllToolDefinitions()` in the main app concatenates;
- the **implementation methods** plus any domain-private helpers;
- the **per-tool metadata**, in part methods the main getters aggregate: `_readOnlyToolNames_part<Name>()` (read/write classification), `_idempotentWriteToolNames_part<Name>()`, `_openWorldToolNames_part<Name>()`, `_developerModeOnlyToolNames_part<Name>()` (only where non-empty), and `_toolDisplayMeta_part<Name>()` (friendly title + overrides-menu summary — every library has this one).

What **stays in `hubitat-mcp-server.groovy`**: the **gateway config** entries in `getGatewayConfig()` (gateway membership is cross-domain), the `executeTool()` **dispatch cases** (one line per tool), the gateway entries of the display-meta map, and the annotation/permission *machinery* (`annotationsForLeaf`/`annotationsForGateway` and the aggregator getters themselves). So the per-tool split is: **library** = definition + implementation + domain-private helpers + classification membership + display meta; **main** = gateway membership + the one-line dispatch case. The native-RM cluster (`hub_set_rule` / `hub_set_native_app` / runtime + CRUD, the #209 closure-gated remainder) is the one domain still resident in main; its defs and metadata stay in main's `_getAllToolDefinitions_part7/8` chunks and aggregator remainders until the wizard-closure smoke test clears its extraction.

`tests/sandbox_lint.py` resolves the `#include`'d library modules before its TOOL_COUNT / read-write-split checks (library-contributed defs AND `_readOnlyToolNames_part*` / `_developerModeOnlyToolNames_part*` chunks are counted), and the Spock harness re-inlines the library so its specs compile unchanged. Shared **generic** helpers (`hubInternalGet`/`hubInternalGetRaw`/the `hubInternal*` family, `mcpLog`, `requireDestructiveConfirm`, `_paginateList`, `formatTimestamp`, `getHubSecurityCookie`, `findDevice`, `_resolveDirectAppId`, `backupItemSource`, `_fetchSourceFromUrl`, the validation functions, the debug-logging engine, etc.) stay in main; libraries call them (resolved after the textual inline). Do NOT cross-`#include` one library from another.

New tools are authored **library-first**: definition + impl + metadata parts in the domain library from day one, with only the gateway entry + dispatch case added to the main file.

### Library granularity + helper placement

- **Group by cohesion + shared domain helpers, not one library per tiny group.** A library is a cohesive *domain* (e.g. all room tools, all bundle tools). Tools that share a domain-specific helper belong in the SAME library so the helper isn't duplicated or cross-`#include`d. Multiple small tool groups MAY share one library when they're cohesive.
- **Helper placement:** a **generic** helper used across many domains (`hubInternalGet`, `mcpLog`, `requireDestructiveConfirm`, `_paginateList`, `formatTimestamp`, …) stays in **main** so any library can call it (textual paste means library code calls main methods, and vice versa, within the one compiled class). A helper used by only **one** library's tools lives **in that library** (e.g. `_parseBundleContent` in `McpBundlesLib`). Place each helper where it minimizes confusion; don't relocate a shared helper into a library that makes other callers reach across modules.

### HPM delivery — bundles, not `libraries[]`

Libraries are delivered to real hubs via an HPM **bundle** (a `.zip`), declared in `packageManifest.json` `bundles[]`. Do NOT use the manifest `libraries[]` array — HPM silently drops it on update (verified upstream). One bundle, `mcp-libraries.zip`, carries every library; it is built deterministically by `tools/build-bundle.py`. Every consumer installs it the HPM way — the hub fetches a zip from a URL; there is no other delivery mechanism.

**Delivery is UNIFIED on the bot-only `bundle-artifacts` branch — the path e2e proves IS the path users ride.** `publish-bundle-artifact.yml` builds the zip on EVERY push (no paths filter, so release-bot commits get entries too) and stores it under `branches/<branch>/` and `shas/<full-sha>/`, always under the production basename (the hub appears to key the bundle entity on the zip filename — a renamed zip can import as a SECOND entity with duplicate libraries instead of updating the existing one; observed in run 27322480301). Nobody rebases that branch, so it has zero conflict surface. Nothing under `bundles/` is committed (the build output dir is gitignored); there is no pre-commit hook, no drift gate, and no post-merge rebuild workflow.

- **HPM users** — `packageManifest.json`'s `bundles[].location` points at `branches/main/`, updated by the same workflow on every push to main.
- **PR e2e** (`mcp_watchdog_deploy.sh`) builds the zip in CI, skips the install only when it is byte-identical to canonical main's artifact AND a live probe proves every `#include`d library on the hub matches the checkout (byte-equality alone can false-skip: a merge landing mid-run leaves a restored hub one merge behind main; a stale hub is healed in-run with canonical main's artifact, which still counts as "unchanged" for the run-scoped bundle-state marker the dead-man restore consults), otherwise installs the PR's `shas/<sha>/` entry after byte-verifying it against the CI build — deterministic builds make those bytes identical to what `branches/main/` will serve once the PR merges — and then VERIFIES every `#include`d library landed (single copy per namespace+name, on-hub length equals the PR file). A library-touching fork PR has no artifact and fails loudly with the remedy (push the branch to the base repo).
- **The e2e arm/restore** records `shas/<MAIN_SHA>/` (immutable — a mid-run merge cannot shift the restore bytes), falling back to `branches/main/` for SHAs predating publish-on-every-push (`resolve_main_bundle_artifact_url` in `mcp_watchdog_lib.sh`, shared with the deploy's skip-compare). Because main DOES move while runs are in flight, the **disarm re-targets the restore at current main** before flipping the flag: it re-resolves main's SHA, rewrites the app URLs (+ re-measured expected chars), the bundle URLs, and canonicalMainSha, and forces the run-scoped bundle-state marker to "changed" when the bundle bytes moved (so the restore cannot skip the bundle leg under a stale marker). Any re-target obstacle falls back to the arm-time manifest unchanged; the dead-man crash path always restores arm-time main (nothing CI-side can re-resolve when CI is dead) and the next run's arm heal + deploy probe close the residual gap.
- **`hub_update_package`** resolves artifact-first (probing the artifact's `.size` marker). Its fallback follows the manifest shape AT the ref: unified manifests fall back to the literal `branches/main/` location (warned when the ref isn't main); legacy refs still carry the old in-tree location and fall back to the zip committed at that ref — old refs keep working unchanged.

The `sandbox-lint` workflow runs the builder in-PR purely as a build smoke (a broken `LIBS` entry fails in-PR).

### BP20 — library file hygiene (avoids a Hubitat parser `Internal error`)

- The `library(...)` declaration MUST be the **first line** of the file. **Zero file-scope commentary before it.**
- Keep comments **inside method bodies**. Avoid file-scope `/* */` / `/** */` blocks and any file-scope comment containing the literal text `library(` or `/* */` — these can fail the hub's parser on save.
- Use **string-literal** handler names for `subscribe`/`schedule` (never bare identifiers).
- Do NOT move `preferences {}`, `mappings {}`, or the RM wizard-walker closures into a library (root-level DSL / unverified closure binding under `#include`).

### Adding (or extracting into) a library — checklist

1. Create `libraries/<name>.groovy` starting with `library(name: "<Name>", namespace: "mcp", author: "...", description: "...")`, then the impl methods, the `_getAllToolDefinitions_part<Name>()` def chunk, and the metadata part methods (`_readOnlyToolNames_part<Name>` / `_idempotentWriteToolNames_part<Name>` / `_openWorldToolNames_part<Name>` where non-empty, `_toolDisplayMeta_part<Name>` always).
2. Add `#include mcp.<Name>` near the top of `hubitat-mcp-server.groovy`, register the def chunk in `getAllToolDefinitions()`, and add each metadata part to its aggregator getter.
3. Add it to `LIBS` in `tools/build-bundle.py`.
4. Do NOT commit anything under `bundles/` (gitignored) — delivery is the `bundle-artifacts` branch, fed automatically on push (see "HPM delivery" above). Run `python tools/build-bundle.py` locally only to verify the builder accepts your `LIBS` entry.
5. The Spock harness auto-resolves `#include` via `src/test/groovy/support/IncludeResolver.groovy` — no harness edit needed. Add the library to `IncludeResolverSpec`'s data-driven real-libraries case.
6. Keep the gateway membership and the `executeTool` dispatch case in main; everything else per-tool — definitions, impls, domain helpers, classification membership, display meta — lives in the library (see "What moves to the library vs stays in the app" above). `check_include_library_lockstep` (sandbox_lint) verifies the `#include` ⇄ library file ⇄ `LIBS` triplet stays in sync.

The `#include` and its `LIBS` entry must stay in lockstep — a missing `LIBS` entry ships a stale bundle that won't deliver the library, so the app fails to compile after an HPM update (or a `hub_update_package` full-repair deploy, which installs the same bundle). When updating a library on a hub by hand during dev, **update the existing library, don't install a second copy** — a duplicate name+namespace creates a second library at a new id and `#include` binds to only one (HPM's normal install flow avoids this).

## PR workflow

Use `.github/pull_request_template.md` — keep every section.

- **Title prefix** matches the ticked `## Type of change` box: `feat:` / `fix:` / `chore:` / `refactor:` / `docs:` / `test:` / `ci:` (`build:` reserved for Dependabot).
- **`## Release Notes`** drives `packageManifest.json` `releaseNotes` (what HPM users see in the update prompt) via `.github/scripts/release_bump.py`. Strongly recommended; write user-facing bullets. If you skip the section the PR title is the fallback. The bot warns on a present-but-unbulleted section.
- **Open as draft** (`gh pr create --draft`); the maintainer flips to ready-for-review.
- **Verify the PR body has both required headings** before claiming the PR is ready (`<N>` = PR number):

  ```bash
  gh pr view <N> --json body --jq '.body' | grep -iE "^#+\s*(Type of change|Release Notes)\s*:?\s*$"
  ```

  Lenient match (case-insensitive, any heading level, optional trailing colon) — same shape `release_bump.py` parses with. Run on rebase/edit too; pre-#146 PRs may not satisfy the template.

## Boy Scout rule

**"Always leave the code better than you found it."**

When you touch a file, you fix the adjacent small stuff you notice — broken comments, stale references, dead pointers, weakly-asserting tests, mis-named variables, redundant code. Not because the PR title told you to, but because you were already in the file and you saw it. The accumulating effect over many PRs is what keeps the codebase from rotting. Skipping the small fix and walking past it is the antipattern, even when it's "not what the PR is about."

This applies to anything within the file or function you're already editing, and to anything one or two file-jumps away that the fix you're making clearly implicates (e.g. a stale comment that references the function you just rewrote, a test assertion that pins the old behaviour, a pointer that points at something you renamed).

## Scope discipline

Scope discipline is the partner rule to Boy Scout — they're different things. Boy Scout governs the small adjacent fixes you make without asking. Scope discipline governs the larger ones you don't.

- **Small or medium fix surfaced during the work** — Boy Scout it. Roll it into the current PR. The PR's commit messages document the extra fix; the PR body's Changes section names it.
- **Large fix** (touches a broad surface, a separate subsystem, or would substantially expand the PR's review surface) — **ASK the user**. Present the option as: roll it in / open a follow-up PR / file a tracking issue / drop it. **The user decides scope, not the AI.** Example: while fixing one dead `.md` pointer you notice the entire rules engine has stale comments referencing renamed functions — that's a wholly separate sweep, ask before rolling in. Another example: the bug fix you came to make requires touching a build script, and the build script has a different conceptual scope (CI vs runtime) — ask.
- **Banned phrasing** — "deferred for follow-up", "out of scope for this fix", "tracking issue", "separate concern", or any variant that defers a real problem the AI just discovered, without the user explicitly saying so. The deflection IS the antipattern; it shifts the cost of remembering onto the maintainer and lets known problems pile up.

When in doubt, treat the problem as in-scope, name it, and surface the trade-off to the user. The user can always shrink the scope; only the user can grow it.

## Boundaries

**🚫 Never edit** — `pr_guard.py` (CI: `.github/workflows/pr-guard.yml`) flags any of these on every PR:
- Version strings in tracked locations (server header comment, `currentVersion()`, rule header, manifest `version`)
- `packageManifest.json` `releaseNotes` or `dateReleased`
- `README.md` `## Version History` section
- `CHANGELOG.md`

All bookkeeping is bot-only. Communicate user-facing changes through your PR's `## Release Notes` section; the post-merge bot handles every file. See [docs/release-automation-design.md](docs/release-automation-design.md).

**⚠️ Ask first** — destructive ops (force-push, branch deletion, hook bypass with `--no-verify` / `--no-gpg-sign`), edits to other contributors' PR descriptions, anything that touches Z-Wave or Zigbee radios on a live test hub.

**✅ Default-OK** — local edits, running tests, opening draft PRs, updating your own PR's description, refactors and bug fixes covered by tests.
